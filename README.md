# Introduction
This repository contains a C# program that demonstrates the execution of an executable directly in memory, bypassing the need for physical storage on the disk. The code downloads an executable from a specified URL, creates a temporary file in the system's temporary directory, and executes the file in-memory without leaving a trace on the hard drive. 


## Features
Downloads an executable from a specified URL.
Executes the executable directly in-memory.
Uses a temporary file to facilitate in-memory execution.
Demonstrates basic process handling and asynchronous execution.

## Usage
Provide the direct download link of the executable in the code.
Run the program, and it will execute the downloaded executable in-memory.
